These are the NCL scripts referenced in the [NCL User Guide](https://ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Manuals/NCL_User_Guide) (NUG).

The NUG was created by Karin Meier-Fleischer and Michael BÃ¶ttinger of [DKRZ](https://www.dkrz.de/) (Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum) with input from NCL developers.

DKRZ has developed an [NCL User Portal](https://www.dkrz.de/up/services/analysis/visualization/sw/ncl/ncl-examples) containing some very nice and unique NCL graphical examples.
